https://github.com/rpdrewes/whisper-websocket-server/tree/main

Simple implementation of a websocket interface to faster-whisper or
whisper.cpp, intended to act like the "kaldi-gstreamer" voice recognition
server for use with Konele app clients from Android phones.

This uses faster-whisper, which can be installed like this:

pip install faster-whisper

This version keeps all received audio data in memory rather than temp file.

This version also incorporates some simple corrections by regex. For
example, if you are talking to someone named "Conor" and
whisper keeps writing this as "Conner" or "Connor" you can have the
transcription automatically change that. See "corrections" below.

example of open from konele. note the user-id in the url, which we send
back with responses:

"GET /client/ws/speech?lang=und&user-agent=RecognizerIntentActivity%2F1.8.14%3B+Google%2Fbarbet%2Flineage_barbet-userdebug+13+TQ1A.230105.001.A2+48648b48b6%3B+null%2Fnull&calling-package=null&user-id=066be6e0-3e5e-4d58-b2e5-fabdd7b549d3&partial=true&content-type=audio%2Fx-raw%2C+layout%3D%28string%29interleaved%2C+rate%3D%28int%2916000%2C+format%3D%28string%29S16LE%2C+channels%3D%28int%291 HTTP/1.1"

what lib can se use to parse that url?

client.py is a program in the kaldi-gstreamer github (link: FIXME) that
is used to test the server.

when client.py connects, this is written by program (or sublibrary) to stderr:
    192.168.1.211 - - [30/Jan/2023 10:42:33] "GET /client/ws/speech?content-type=audio%2Fx-raw%2C+layout%3D%28string%29interleaved%2C+rate%3D%28int%2916000%2C+format%3D%28string%29S16LE%2C+channels%3D%28int%291 HTTP/1.1" 101 46
when konele connects, this is written by this program (or sublibrary) to stderr:
    192.168.1.144 - - [30/Jan/2023 10:44:37] "GET /client/ws/speech?lang=und&user-agent=RecognizerIntentActivity%2F1.8.14%3B+Google%2Fbarbet%2Flineage_barbet-userdebug+13+TQ1A.230105.001.A2+48648b48b6%3B+null%2Fnull&calling-package=null&user-id=066be6e0-3e5e-4d58-b2e5-fabdd7b549d3&partial=true&content-type=audio%2Fx-raw%2C+layout%3D%28string%29interleaved%2C+rate%3D%28int%2916000%2C+format%3D%28string%29S16LE%2C+channels%3D%28int%291 HTTP/1.1" 101 46
    SO: konele is sending x-raw audio, interleaved, rate 16000, S16LE, channels 1
    with this rate, the audio will be 8000 samples/second (16 bits per sample)

the audio encoding is present in both, but only konele sends the
"user-id" info which is presumably sent back by server on each communication?

WHO is writing that URL?

limitations:
    audio must be 8k samples/second, each sample 16 bits signed, so 16KB/s of data
    only one request at a time
    no incremental results yet
    no authentication on connection
